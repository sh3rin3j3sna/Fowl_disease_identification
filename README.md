# About the project 

The project motivation is classifying fowl with coccidiosis through image analysis.The classifier used is CNN. 

Some sneak peak to the fowl disease.

Coccidiosis is caused by parasites that infect the cells lining an animalâ€™s intestine. Animals get infected by swallowing the parasites. This can happen by eating infected pasture and feed, drinking contaminated water, or by grooming themselves.
